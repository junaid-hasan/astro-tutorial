# My First Blog Post

Published on 2024-18-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! I will share my journey in building the new website.

## What I have accomplished
1. **Installing Astro**: First installed astro, created a project, and setup the online accounts.
2. **Making Pages**: Then I learned about creating `.astro` files and placing them in `src/pages/` folder. These are processed by astro to valid html files.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This one is the first blog. But basically I am writing a markdown file under the folder `src/pages/posts` and this would be processed by astro to a valid html file.

## What's next
I will write my future learnings/takeaways below.
